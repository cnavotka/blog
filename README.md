### Title

I decided to organise a "Blog" or notepad with ideas or concepts for a future website for myself.

## Table of Contents

### UX

The website is aimed at users who want to learn about cyber security or they are interested in finding out more about networks.



#### User Stories

- As a user I like to find the information for a selected area easily and fast.

- The information needs to be clear and short.

- As a site visitor, I would like to gain an understanding of the website's purpose from the landing page.

- I would like to easily navigate through the site and find what I am looking for with an ease.

- As a site visitor, I would like to find the aesthetics of the website enjoyable and I want to use interactive elements on the website.


### Colours

I decided to use a light gray background with black and blue to mimick the Gopher Protocol, used during my firsts contacts with the Internet.

### Fonts

I decided to use Prompt, to make easy the reading considering the clourway of the project is retro.

### Strategy

### Scope

- Interactive features that allow the user to engage and find needed information.
